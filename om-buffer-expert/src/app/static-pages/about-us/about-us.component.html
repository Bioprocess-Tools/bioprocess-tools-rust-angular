    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Welcome to bioprocess-tools.com, the go-to-place for buffer design, today! 
      Our vision is to revolutionize research by making advanced modeling tools accessible to everyone across the globe. 
      Today, most of these tools are hidden in books and journal articles, severely hindering the ability for the average 
      scientist or engineer to understand characterize and improve their processes.

      We believe that we are significantly behind in translating our scientific and engineering understanding of processes, 
      especially first-priniciples knowledge into insights and modeling of our processes.
    
      This cannot be done by one person or a small team, so we seek your help, support and feedback.
