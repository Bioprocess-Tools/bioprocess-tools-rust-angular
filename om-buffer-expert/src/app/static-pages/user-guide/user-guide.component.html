      <p>Welcome to our software tool, a comprehensive tool that enables you to
        design your buffers. The
        calculation engine is a first-principles based predictor, and has been
        time-tested. The algorithm used
        is so powerful, robust, and fast, that it can handle the very non-linear
        nature of the solution. Henderson Hasselbalch equation is typically used for buffer calculation, but it is severly limited, as it works for a single dissociation constant for a single buffering species.       </p>
        <p>With this designer & calculator, you can perform comprehensive calculations and use it for acid base titration, understand buffer chemistry, determining pH of a solution, titration end point, as well as determining the recipe or buffer composition for your buffer.</p>

                  While this is not a limitation of the Designer calculation
                  engine, we imposed these constraints to produce meaningful

                  that the ionic strength correction has its limitations, as
                  these corrections are not accurate beyond 0.4M. Since the
                  GenAI Designer doesnt have this limitation, you can
                  choose a broad range of concentrations, but will likely result
                  in recipes that are not meaningful.

            <p>Buffers are generally composed of a buffering species (such as
              Phosphate) and a counter-ion (Sodium), and
              optionally a fully ionized salt, such as Sodium Chloride.
              The buffering species provides the specific characteristic of the
              buffer, due to its dissociation properties. Buffering species can
              have multiple dissociation steps, with each step having a specific
              dissociation constant (referred to as pKa). For a detailed
              explanation of the dissociation constants jump to the section
              below.</p>

            <p>Counter-ions are ions that are present in a buffering solution
              that provide the appropriate charge balance to achieve a specific
              pH. See the charge balance equations
              below in the next section for details. The counter-ions should
              produce ions of the opposite charge to be able to modify the pH.</p>

            <p>In order to prepare buffered solutions, we typically use
              compounds containing the buffering species, either in a "pure"
              form,
              (eg. Phosphoric Acid) or "salt form" where the buffering species
              is present in combination with the counter ion (eg. Sodium
              Phosphate Monobasic). </p>
            <p>If a pure form is chosen as one of the compounds, then the
              counter-ion is supplied separately as a "strong acid" (eg.
              Hydrochloric Acid) or
              "strong base" (eg. Sodium Hydroxide), depending on the counter-ion
              desired. We can call this pairing as "Weak Acid/Base" -
              "Strong Base/Acid".</p>
            <p>If a salt form is chosen as one of the compounds, and if the
              compound in solution is "acidic", then the secondary compound is
              chosen to be one that will be "basic"
              essentially to provide the charge balance to achieve the target
              pH. There are several scenarios with this pairing, which are
              described, and the way to achieve the target pH
              and concentration in the app are included below.</p>

                  Gen AI Input Considerations
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p> GenAI Buffer Designer Input: The GenAI Buffer Designer is
                quite flexible in handling different type of inputs. First it
                checks if the input has one or more of the buffer species, and
                will not allow for you to proceed
                without it. The concentration of the buffer can be specified as
                0.4M or 40mM. If you skip the units, it will interpret the
                number to be mM if it is greater than 1 and as M if it is less
                than 1. You can
                specify the concentration within parenthesis. You need to
                specify the salt with compound names. You can use "salt" for
                Sodium Chloride. Please note that the salts in the
                classic Designer, namely Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride and
                Ammonium Sulfate are the only salts you can specify in GenAI
                too. You also need to use the word pH in the request,
                with the value specified generally anywhere in context. For
                example, this will yield the right recipe: Yo dude can you whip
                me up a seventy one phosphate with good chunk of hundred Sodium
                Chloride with an awesome pH of seven?</p>
              <!-- Include subsections or further detailed information here -->
            </mat-expansion-panel>

            <mat-expansion-panel>
              <mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <mat-panel-title>
                  Single buffering species
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>

              <p>1. Single buffering species, with each compound containing both
                the counter-ion and the buffering species - Example: Sodium
                Phosphate Monobasic, Sodium Phosphate Dibasic.
                Here both compounds contain Phosphate as the buffering species,
                which is a negatively charged buffering species. The counter-ion
                is Sodium (positively charged) and is supplied
                by both compounds.</p>

              <p>In specifying this buffer in the app with the
                "Classic Buffer Designer", you can pick an acidic compound from
                the first list, and a basic compound from the
                second list, such that both contain the same buffering species
                and the same counter-ion. Then you can specify the target buffer
                concentration, which specifies the total buffering species
                concentration in the final buffer and the target pH. The Design
                calculation engine will then determine the right proportion of
                each compound to achieve the target pH, while
                maintaining the target buffering species concentration.</p>

              <p>With the GenAI Input, you can simply specify the buffering
                species (eg. Phosphate), specifying the target concentration as
                40mM Phosphate. The Designer in this case will
                pick the appropriate compounds (typically two compounds, both
                containing the buffering species, with one or both containing
                the counter-ion). The target pH is simply requested as
                "with a pH of X". </p>

              <p>2. Single buffering species, with one compound containing the
                buffering species - counter ion combination, and the other
                compound containing the counter-ion only.
                Example: Sodium Phosphate Monobasic and Sodium Hydroxide. Here
                the Sodium Phosphate Monobasic provides both Phosphate and
                Sodium, while the Sodium Hydroxide provides the counter-ion
                only.
                Again, the Sodium Phosphate Monobasic is "acidic" in solution
                and the Sodium Hydroxide is "basic" in solution, forming a pair.
                Notice that the "strong base" (Sodium Hydroxide)
                has the same ion as the ion in the first compound. While this is
                desirable to keep the solution simple, it is necessary to choose
                the same counter-ion. For example, you can
                choose Potassium Hydroxide, to achieve the target pH. </p>

              <p>In specifying this buffer in the app with the
                "Classic Buffer Designer", you can pick a compound in either of
                the list containing the buffering species counter-ion salt, and
                then
                choose the other compound which contains only the counter-ion.
                Again, you will specify the target buffering species
                concentration in the final solution, and the target pH.
                The Design calculation engine will determine the right
                concentration of the two compounds to achieve the target pH,
                while achieving the target buffering species concentration.</p>

              <p>You cannot achieve this with GenAI input currently, as
                mentioned above, it only chooses the pair with both containing
                the buffering species.
                <!-- Include subsections or further detailed information here -->
              </mat-expansion-panel>

                    Two buffering species
                  </mat-panel-title>
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>

                3. Two buffering species, achieved with two compounds one of
                each containing only the "pure form" of the buffering species.
                One will choose the buffering species such that one
                contributes the positive (or basic) ions and the other the
                negative (or acidic) ions. A popular example of this, is
                Acetate-Tris buffer, where Acetic Acid and Tris Base
                combined to produce the buffer. In designing this buffer, you
                will first choose Acetic Acid from the first list and Tris Base
                from the second list. It is important to note
                that the target concentration refers to the buffering species in
                the acidic component and not the basic component (the
                flexibility of choosing either will be a future improvement in
                the app).
                With a target pH, the Design calculation engine will find the
                concentration of the second compoound that will achieve the
                target pH

                <p>With GenAI, you can easily achieve this by specifying it like
                  this "Make a 50mM Acetate Tris buffer, with pH of 5" to get
                  the similar behavior as with the Classic Designer.
                  However with GenAI, you can also achieve the reverse case
                  easily, for example, you can target a 50mM Tris, by saying
                  "Make a 50mM Tris Acetate buffer, pH 8". In this case the
                  GenAI Designer will achieve a Tris concentration of 50mM and
                  adjust Acetic acid to achieve the target pH. </p>

                <p>3. Two buffering species, achieved with two compounds, each
                  containing a different buffering species, both may be salt
                  forms or one pure and one salt form. In either case the target
                  concentration refers to the concentration of the acidic
                  compound. The other compound is adjusted to achieve the target
                  pH. </p>

                <p>You cannot achieve this with GenAI input currently, as the
                  Gen AI Designer automatically chooses the buffering compounds
                  that will make the buffer. </p>

                <p>With each of these options, you can optionally choose to add
                  a salt compound and specify the concentration. The salt
                  concentration, along with concentration of the buffering
                  compounds plays a critical role in ionic strength of the
                  solution, which affects the dissociation constant of the
                  buffering species, and hence the pH.</p>

                    pH and target buffer concentration limits
                  </mat-panel-title>
                </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                pH range choice limits: Please note that when certain compounds
                are chosen, with the specified target concentrations, only
                limited range of pH can be achieved, due to the inherent
                chemistry involved. In this case, an error will be reported
                below the result, with the range of achievable pH. Of course
                this will vary depending on the compounds, target concentration,
                etc.

                Concentration and pH limits: The classic Designer has built in
                constraints on the choice of concentrations for the target
                concentration for the buffer compounds and salt compounds.
                While this is not a limitation of the Designer calculation
                engine, we imposed these constraints to produce meaningful
                buffers, normally used in practice. Further, please realize
                that the ionic strength correction has its limitations, as these
                corrections are not accurate beyond 0.4M. Since the GenAI
                Designer doesnt have this limitation, you can
                choose a broad range of concentrations, but will likely result
                in recipes that are not meaningful.

                pH Calculator gives the full flexibiity to specify the acidic

                respectively, and an optional salt compound and its
                concentration, and then have the pH calculator determine the pH
                of the solution. While the calculator will provide the accurate
                prediction of the pH of the solution, it is then
                upto you to determine if this is a viable and useful buffer.

              <ul>
                <li>Since the Design calculation engine is based on
                  first-principles, ionic species level details are available
                  for each ion in solution. For the sake of simplicity, the
                  results are
                  summarized as provided in the app.
                </li>

                <li> The first output you see is the Buffer Composition Summary,
                  which provides the compound name and molar concentration of
                  each of the compounds in solution, as well as the actual pH
                  achieved, to 3 decimal precision. Internally the engine
                  targets a tolerance of 10^-6.
                  Below the Buffer Composition Summary, you get a status card,
                  which shows green if the results were achieved or shows red,
                  and provides comments if there were any errors. In general,
                  you
                  can expect to see more errors with the GenAI as there are no
                  constraints on the input. With the pH Calculator, you will see
                  the least errors as you are requesting a pH calculation versus
                  targeting
                  a buffer concentration and pH level. </li>

                <li> Next, you see the Buffer List and Details. Here each of the
                  buffers that were calculated, regardless of the calculator
                  that you used, are listed here. You can scroll horizontally
                  to browse the buffers. The buffer that was last
                  calculated is highlighted with green. Alternatively, if you
                  had clicked the "Details" button, the buffer whose details are
                  shown below will be highlighted with a green outline.
                  You can click on the details button on any buffer card to get
                  its details. </li>

                <li>The next button is the Edit button, which designed to

                  pH calculator
                  regardless of what produced the results. You can then go to
                  either of tabs and edit the appropriate values to create a new
                  buffer. Note that the concentrations are rounded to three
                  decimal
                  precision, which could result in minor errors in the results
                  when you try editing on a different calculator. </li>

                <li>Below the scroll llist, we have the next level details on
                  the Compounds in the buffer. For each of the compounds, we

                  (g/L)
                  . We also identify the buffer ion in that compound. Next, for
                  each compound, we provide the ions in the compound, and their
                  total molar concentration.
                </li>
                <li>Next, we provide details at the ion level. We identify the
                  unique ions in the buffer. For each unique ion, we provide the

                  Keep
                  in mind that the ion concentrations includes both the buffer
                  and non-buffer compounds. The ionic species concentration is

              <h2>Charge Balance Equation:</h2>
              <p>The charge balance equation ensures that the total positive

                system with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>,
                and NaCl, we consider all species that contribute to the charge,
                including the dissociation products of phosphoric acid and the
                ions from NaCl.</p>

              <p>Here's how the charge balance equation would look for this

              <p>By solving the charge balance equation, in combination with the
                dissociation equations, while accounting for the mass balance,
                you can calculate the [H<sup>+</sup>], which gives us the pH.

                Given that the pkA depends on the ionic strength, one needs to
                incorporate corrections to the pKA using Debye-Huckel
                approximations. The calculation engine incorporates this
                correction. However, as mentioned before,
                the correction is only applicable upto 0.4M ionic strength,
                beyond which the actual results and predicted results will
                likely not match.

                  What are buffers and how do they work?
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>

              <p>Buffers are a fundamental concept in chemistry, particularly in
                the context of maintaining pH levels in various environments. A
                buffer is essentially a solution that can resist changes in pH
                when small quantities of acid or base are added. This property
                is crucial in many biological and chemical processes where the
                pH must remain relatively constant. The ability of a buffer to
                maintain pH is due to the presence of a weak acid and its
                conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid, in
                significant concentrations. These components work together to
                neutralize added acids or bases, thus preventing drastic changes
                in pH levels.</p>

              <p>In practical terms, when an acid (proton donor) is introduced
                into a buffer system, the conjugate base present in the buffer
                will bind the free hydrogen ions, thereby mitigating the
                increase in acidity. Conversely, if a base (proton acceptor) is
                added, the weak acid in the buffer donates hydrogen ions to
                counteract the rise in basicity. This dual capacity to moderate
                pH changes makes buffers indispensable in chemical reactions and
                biological systems that are sensitive to pH fluctuations, such
                as enzymatic pathways and cellular environments.</p>

              <p>The effectiveness of a buffer is determined by its capacity,
                which is the amount of acid or base the buffer can neutralize,
                and by its range, which is the pH spectrum over which the buffer
                acts effectively. Commonly, buffers are designed to work
                optimally within a pH range close to the pKa of the acid
                component of the buffer system. This range is typically within
                one pH unit above or below the pKa value. The careful selection
                and application of buffer systems are thus crucial in many
                scientific and industrial processes.</p>

                  Where are buffers used?
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>

              <p> Buffers are utilized across a wide array of scientific
                disciplines and industrial applications due to their ability to
                stabilize pH levels. In biology, buffers are vital for
                maintaining the pH of biological fluids, such as blood, which is
                essential for proper physiological function. Enzymatic
                reactions, often highly sensitive to pH, rely on buffers to
                create an optimal environment for activity and stability. Beyond
                the human body, buffers are also essential in agricultural
                practices, environmental monitoring, and food science, where pH
                control is necessary for maintaining the health of ecosystems
                and ensuring the safety and quality of food products.</p>

              <p>In the pharmaceutical industry, buffers play a pivotal role in
                drug formulation and stability. They help maintain the pH of a
                drug product within a narrow range to prevent degradation and
                ensure consistent therapeutic efficacy. In drug design, buffers
                are used to enhance solubility and bioavailability of
                medications. In analytical chemistry, buffers are essential for
                techniques such as chromatography and spectroscopy, where
                precise pH control is required to achieve accurate and
                reproducible results.</p>

              <p>Moreover, buffers are utilized in various technological
                applications, such as water treatment processes, where they
                assist in maintaining the pH balance to ensure safe drinking
                water. They also find applications in chemical manufacturing,
                where they are used in catalytic reactions, and in material
                science, particularly in the production of polymers and other
                advanced materials. The versatility of buffers makes them a
                cornerstone in both basic and applied sciences.</p>

                  How are buffers used in biopharma and biotechnology?
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>In biopharmaceutical and biotechnological processes, buffers
                are indispensable for both upstream and downstream processing.
                During the upstream phase, buffers are used to maintain the pH
                of culture media within a range that is optimal for cell growth
                and protein expression. By keeping the pH stable, buffers ensure
                that the cells are producing the desired biologics, such as
                therapeutic proteins, under the most favorable conditions. This
                is crucial since even slight deviations in pH can significantly
                affect cell health and productivity.</p>

              <p> During downstream processing, buffers are integral to the
                purification and stabilization of biopharmaceuticals. They are
                used in chromatography, a key technique for purifying
                proteins, where the buffer composition can directly affect the
                binding and elution of proteins from the chromatography media.
                Buffers also play a role in protecting these biomolecules from
                denaturation or degradation due to pH fluctuations. For
                instance, they ensure that antibodies retain their structure
                and functionality throughout the purification process, which
                is vital for their efficacy as therapeutic
                agents.</p>

              <p>In addition to their role in production, buffers are also
                crucial in the formulation of biopharmaceutical products. They
                are used to adjust the pH of the final product to ensure
                stability and prolong shelf life. For sensitive biologics,
                such as vaccines or gene therapy vectors, buffers safeguard
                against pH-induced damage during storage and transport. As
                such, the careful selection and optimization of buffers are
                fundamental steps in the development and manufacturing of
                biopharmaceuticals, impacting the quality and safety of these
                critical healthcare products.</p>

                  Typical types of buffers used in bioprocesses and their
                  characteristics
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>Bioprocessing requires buffers that are not only effective at
                pH stabilization but also meet stringent safety and
                compatibility requirements. Good's buffers, named after Norman
                Good, who identified them, are a class of zwitterionic organic
                chemical buffering agents that have become the gold standard in
                biological research. These buffers, such as HEPES, MOPS, and
                Tris, are designed to have minimal biological effects, making
                them suitable for cell culture and enzymatic reactions. They
                have pKa values close to physiological pH, which is typically
                around 7.4, allowing them to maintain pH without interfering
                with cellular processes</p>

              <p> Another characteristic of buffers used in bioprocessing is
                their limited absorption at wavelengths used for biological
                assays, thereby minimizing interference in UV-spectrophotometric
                and fluorescence-based measurements. This is critical in
                analytical and diagnostic applications where the presence of the
                buffer should not affect the accuracy of the results.
                Additionally, Good's buffers have low membrane permeability,
                which is important for maintaining pH gradients across cell
                membranes, a vital aspect of many biological processes</p>

              <p>Bioprocessing also requires buffers to be free of contaminants
                such as heavy metals or endotoxins, which could interfere with
                cell growth or product purity. As a result, high purity and
                stringent quality control are necessary for buffers used in
                these applications. The choice of buffer can also impact the
                scalability of bioprocessing operations, with considerations for
                how buffers will be stored, handled, and disposed of, thus
                affecting the overall sustainability and cost-efficiency of the
                manufacturing process</p>

                  Typical buffers used in the purification of antibodies
                </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>Antibody purification is a critical step in the production of
                monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, which are used for
                therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The purification process
                often involves the use of affinity chromatography, utilizing
                materials such as Protein A, G, and L, which bind specifically
                to the Fc region of antibodies. Buffers are essential in this
                process, as they provide the correct pH and ionic strength
                needed for antibodies to bind and subsequently be eluted from
                the chromatography media</p>

              <p>The choice of buffer in antibody purification is influenced by
                the type of antibody, the desired purity, and the specific
                affinity material being used. For instance, Protein A affinity
                chromatography, commonly used for purifying IgG antibodies,
                requires a specific buffer composition for optimal binding and
                elution. These buffers typically include a loading buffer to
                prepare the sample, a wash buffer to remove non-specifically
                bound proteins, and an elution buffer to release the bound
                antibodies.</p>

              <p>Post-purification, the antibodies may be subject to additional
                processing steps such as desalting or buffer exchange to prepare
                them for final formulation. These steps ensure that the
                antibodies are in a buffer that is suitable for storage or
                further use, such as in a therapeutic context. The final buffer
                must be chosen carefully to maintain antibody stability and
                activity over time.</p>

              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>The quality of buffer chemicals is paramount in
                biopharmaceutical manufacturing, where the highest standards of
                purity and consistency are required. Buffers must be free from
                contaminants that could interfere with the bioprocess or
                compromise the safety of the final product. This necessitates
                the use of high-purity chemicals and adherence to Good
                Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) throughout the production and
                handling of these buffer components.</p>

              <p>Quality assurance of buffer chemicals involves rigorous testing
                and documentation to ensure that they meet all regulatory
                requirements. This includes assessing the chemical's provenance,
                ensuring that raw materials are sourced from reputable
                suppliers, and that the manufacturing process is controlled and
                traceable. The ability to track the origin and handling of
                buffer materials is essential for auditing and compliance
                purposes, particularly in an industry that is heavily
                regulated.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, the manufacturing of buffer chemicals for
                biopharmaceutical applications often requires additional
                certifications, such as ISO standards, which further validate
                the quality and reliability of the products. The demand for
                high-quality buffer chemicals has led to the development of
                specialized grades of these materials, specifically designed to
                meet the stringent requirements of the biopharmaceutical
                industry.</p>
